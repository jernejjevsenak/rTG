Dear CRAN, 

This is a regular update of the rTG package. There are two main updates, 1) I improved the model fitting procedure for Gompertz function, which now prevents to fit a straight line; 2) I have added two additional output elements - tables with the output coefficients for Gompertz and double Gompertz functions

Best,
Jernej
