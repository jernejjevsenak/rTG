Dear CRAN

This is the first submission of the rTG r package. This is new r package providing methods for the analysis of seasonal radial tree growth of trees and woody species. It is focused on the comparison of different fitting methods (brnn, GAM and Gompertz) and to suggest user the optimal fitting method.
