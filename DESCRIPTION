Title: Methods to Analyse Seasonal Radial Tree Growth Data
Version: 0.2.2
Author: Jernej Jevsenak [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Jernej Jevsenak <jernej.jevsenak@gmail.com>
Description: Methods for comparing different regression algorithms for 
    describing the temporal dynamics of secondary tree growth (xylem and 
    phloem). Users can compare the accuracy of the most common fitting methods 
    usually used to analyse xylem and phloem data, i.e., Gompertz function and 
    General Additive Models (GAMs); and an algorithm newly introduced to the 
    field, i.e., Bayesian Regularised Neural Networks (brnn). The core function
    of the package is XPSgrowth(), while the results can be interpreted using 
    implemented generic S3 methods, such as plot() and summary().
